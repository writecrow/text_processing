Christian Fleetwood (1840–1914) was an African-American non-commissioned officer who enlisted in the Union Army in 1863, during the American Civil War. He was given the rank of sergeant upon enlistment, and was later promoted to sergeant major. The following year, his unit, the 4th United States Colored Infantry Regiment, took part in the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, suffering heavy casualties. When the flag-bearer was wounded, Fleetwood, along with private Charles Veale, each grabbed a flag before the colors could touch the ground, and continued through heavy enemy fire. For their actions during the battle, each man received the Medal of Honor. After the war, he worked as a bookkeeper and served in the District of Columbia National Guard.

Digital Privacy & Information Security
After the terrorist attacks of 9/ 11, US Government has taken digital spying to a new level. A month later, President George Bush signed the USA Patriot Act, which enables the government to spy on citizen, to prevent future terrorists. In 2011, President Barack Obama renewed the Patriot Act. The Act expanded the government's right to conduct surveillance in order to improve security. Since then, FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) has been conducting data collection (Greenwald, 2014). One prominent surveillance program is phone surveillance, in which the government collects metadata about phone records.
According to Darrel West, director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, when the Patriot Act was first passed, it was supported by most people, now, after a decade, people began to worry that the government may abuse the power, and wanted to scale it back (Kelly, 2015). A debate has been raised: "Should the law allow the government to spy on citizen?" I believe that the government can and should continue spying to improve safety and security.
Nowadays, Internet has been growing stronger and more hazardous. Internet seems to belong to everyone, and give freedom and power to people, thus making Internet a dangerous place. Many criminals have use the cyberspace for deception, pornography, bank penetration, and blackmailing. According to Brenner, a Professor of Law and Technology at the University of Dayton School of Law, violent serial offenders have used the Internet to find and lure victims. Individuals have committed suicide after being victimized by cyber bullying (Casey, 2011).
The reason why Internet has become such a danger is because it has not been strictly controlled yet. All other forms of mass media including television and radio have specific regulations and administrative controls in place, for example, the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission has the right to restrict content, censor obscene material, require balance and fairness in political programs (Michael, 2004). That is why, the internet should be no different. Letting the government filters and censor Internet content will help increase the safety of people's life and property, while minimizing the loss of cyber attacks in the long run. For example, internet censorship will help keep the exploitation of children to a minimal and lessening the spread of drug cartels. Also, it makes it easier to stop online criminal activity and ensure that this type of crime does not take place. As a result, the cyber attacks will decrease, and more people will be safer.
Another reason the government should be allowed to spy is because the ISIS, a notorious terrorist group, has become stronger on the Internet. Two factors that make ISIS stronger are that they have been recruiting more foreign fighters over social media, and they are trying to do cyber attack on the government. Firstly, according to the reports by the European Union, there is a concerning increase in recruitment rates and patterns, with ISIS being more successful at recruiting young individuals from Western countries than any other jihadist group (Vergani & Bliuc, 2015). Secondly, ISIS has looked to expand its online capabilities in order to carry out cyber attack against U.S. targets, including the federal government and airplanes (Kavanaugh, 2015). According to some security expert, although this group has not been able to do serious damage, I believe a lesson of 9/11 is enough for the government to take precaution by collecting information by spying beforehand to prevent horrific attacks rather than spending money for recovery.
Nevertheless, many people, based on the First Amendment right of association, claimed that government's mass surveillance violates the rule. The First Amendment right of association is based on the freedom to assemble without government interference (U.S. Const. amend. I). When the NSA collects data about the numbers a person calls and how often, that data can reveal a personâ€™s protected associations, and the surveillance constitutes an interference with the right of association. This is not entirely true, the phone surveillance only collects data records which include the number of phone, destination, and call duration, without any particular name. If the NSA wants to know target's name and call content, they have to get permission from court and phone company (Jonathan, 2013). In short, NSA only violates the rule when they know the target's name and call content, yet, in this case, since they do not know about those information, their actions are legal.
Another counterclaim is that some people are afraid the government checks all their private information and take control over their lives. I believe that if our profiles are clear, there is nothing to be worried about. The government only targets and put more pressure on those who have high crime coefficient or potential to commit a crime. But even when the government tries to collect information, there is a limitation to government's surveillance. An example of this is the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013 carried out by two brothers Tsarnaev. Prior to the bombing, US government was warned by Russia, the FBI had questioned him, the CIA had placed him in their terrorist database, he read Al Qaeda's online magazine and watched Islamist videos on YouTube. However, it took even three days after the bombing to find photos and security videos of the brothers, and law enforcement did not have their names (Bluto, 2013). In other words, the surveillance program only helps the government knows more about the potential terrorist attack and be prepared for situations, the spying is not completely powerful enough to control people's lives.
Another reason one does not have to fear that the government may abuse this power of spying on people is that there are currently two branches, executive branch and legislative branch examining NSA surveillance. The executive branch, although powerful, must ensure the Congress is informed of activities. Working together, the two branches can check upon one another and ensure that both legally, and by policy (Kelly, 2015). Thus, there is very little or no chance that NSA can abuse their power.
In conclusion, I acknowledge that there are good reasons for people to fight for their digital privacy, I would rather let the government monitor people and avoid major problems in the future rather than thinking about privacy in the short run. Of course, we should be given a certain freedom, but I don't think the surveillance would do harm than good because it is executed by law and strictly under check of another part of the government.
